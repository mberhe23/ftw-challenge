# Congratulations on Completing Fast Track Weekend!

## Continuing with Flatiron School

We know many of you came to Fast Track in an effort to expedite your application and journey in code with Flatiron School. We couldn't be more excited. Here are things you can do to ensure a speedy and successful application process.

### Complete 75% of the Intro to Ruby Curriculum

We'd love to see you work through at least 75% of the ruby curriculum you started during FastTrack. That means completing all the READMEs and Labs until [Tic Tac Toe Play Loop](https://learn.co/tracks/intro-to-ruby-development/ruby-basics/loops/tic-tac-toe-play-loop) (https://learn.co/tracks/intro-to-ruby-development/ruby-basics/loops/tic-tac-toe-play-loop). The more you complete in this and [Bootcamp Prep](https://flatironschool.com/free-courses/coding-bootcamp-prep/) (https://flatironschool.com/free-courses/coding-bootcamp-prep/) the better. But 75% is a minimum in the next few days to qualify for the expedited admissions process. When you complete that much of the curriculum, just let your admissions counselor know by email or phone and we'll check and continue the process.

### Complete Our Code Challenge

Included in this within main.rb is a set of challenges and questions. Fork this REPL and complete the code challenges in main.rb. Send your submission to avi@flatironschool.com and to your admissions counselor by Tuesday, February 4th, 2020.

### Complete Our PBJ No Code Challenge

Complete the quiz at [PBJ Code](https://fis.cm/pbj-code) (https://fis.cm/pbj-code). Please use the SAME EMAIL ADDRESS YOU USED TO APPLY TO THE SCHOOL OR REGISTER FOR FASTTRACK otherwise it is very hard for us to find your submission. Please complete this by Tuesday, February 4th, 2020

## Most Important

The most important thing is for you to continue making progress and learning more code. It is so important for us to ensure that you will succeed in the format of the program and the more preparing you do the more likely your goals will be acheived. So even if you miss deadlines or have a hard time with the technical interview, keep learning, keep coming to our events, keep learning, and stay in touch with us and re-apply. We'll do everything we can to help you change your life.
